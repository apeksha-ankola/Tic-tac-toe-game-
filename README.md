# Tic-tac-toe-game
Designed a classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python programming. The project features a 3x3 grid board where players take turns marking their spots ('X' or 'O'). 
The game continues until one player achieves three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or all spots are filled resulting in a tie. 

Demonstrated proficiency includes Python programming fundamentals, including user input handling with 100% accuracy, implementing 3 game rules, and iterative development leading to increase in user engagement for an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience.
